# Huginn Chess Engine - Development Status

## âœ… Completed Features

### Move Undo System
- **S_UNDO Structure**: Complete undo state structure implemented
  ```cpp
  struct S_UNDO {
      int move;                 // encoded move (from/to/promo packed)
      uint8_t castling_rights;  // previous castling permissions  
      int ep_square;            // previous en passant square
      uint16_t halfmove_clock;  // previous fifty move counter
      uint64_t zobrist_key;     // previous position key
      Piece captured;           // captured piece (if any)
  };
  ```
- **Optimized Array-Based Storage**: Fixed-size array `std::array<S_UNDO, MAXPLY>` for maximum performance
  - **MAXPLY = 2048**: Maximum search depth / game length
  - **No dynamic allocation**: Zero malloc/free overhead during search
  - **Cache-friendly**: Contiguous memory layout
  - **Direct indexing**: O(1) access via `move_history[ply]`
  - **Overflow protection**: Prevents moves beyond MAXPLY limit
- **Enhanced Position API**:
  - `make_move_with_undo(const Move& m)` - Makes move and saves undo state
  - `undo_move()` - Undoes last move, returns success/failure
  - `ply` counter for search depth tracking
  - Automatic state preservation and restoration
- **Move Encoding/Decoding**: Efficient packing of move data into single integer
- **Full State Restoration**: Complete position state restoration including:
  - Board position
  - Side to move
  - Castling rights
  - En passant square
  - Halfmove clock
  - Zobrist key
  - Piece counts and bitboards

### Unified Board Representation (Previously Completed)
- Modern `Position` struct with all S_BOARD features
- Type-safe Piece and Color enums
- 120-square mailbox board representation
- Zobrist hashing integration
- Move generation framework (knights implemented)

## ðŸš§ In Progress / TODO

### Enhanced Move Making
- [ ] Castling move handling in make_move_with_undo
- [ ] En passant capture handling
- [ ] Double pawn push en passant square setting
- [ ] Promotion handling refinement

### Search Integration
- [ ] Integrate undo system with search algorithms
- [ ] Perft testing with undo functionality
- [ ] Alpha-beta search using move history

### Move Generation Expansion
- [ ] Complete move generation for all piece types
- [ ] Legal move filtering (check detection)
- [ ] Special move generation (castling, en passant)

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Zobrist key incremental updates during make/undo
- [ ] Bitboard updates during make/undo
- [ ] Move ordering integration

## ðŸ“š VICE Tutorial Continuation

The engine now has a complete undo system that matches and extends the VICE tutorial's S_UNDO structure. Next steps align with continuing the VICE tutorial for search algorithms and move generation completeness.
