# Castling Validation Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the debug validation system with comprehensive castling validation that ensures castling rights are consistent with actual piece positions on the board.

## Validation Logic

### Core Principle
If the FEN string or position indicates that castling is possible for a particular side and direction, then the required pieces (King and Rook) **must** be on their starting squares.

### Specific Validations

#### White Castling Rights
- **CASTLE_WK (White Kingside)**: 
  - King must be on e1 (`Piece::WhiteKing`)
  - Rook must be on h1 (`Piece::WhiteRook`)

- **CASTLE_WQ (White Queenside)**:
  - King must be on e1 (`Piece::WhiteKing`)
  - Rook must be on a1 (`Piece::WhiteRook`)

#### Black Castling Rights
- **CASTLE_BK (Black Kingside)**:
  - King must be on e8 (`Piece::BlackKing`)
  - Rook must be on h8 (`Piece::BlackRook`)

- **CASTLE_BQ (Black Queenside)**:
  - King must be on e8 (`Piece::BlackKing`)
  - Rook must be on a8 (`Piece::BlackRook`)

## Implementation

### Function: `validate_castling_consistency()`
Located in `src/debug.cpp`, this function:

1. **Checks each castling right individually** - validates each of the 4 possible castling flags
2. **Validates piece placement** - ensures Kings and Rooks are on correct starting squares
3. **Provides detailed error messages** - shows exactly which piece is missing or misplaced
4. **Handles partial castling** - correctly validates positions where only some castling rights remain

### Integration
- Automatically called by `validate_position_consistency()`
- Can be called independently: `Debug::validate_castling_consistency(pos)`
- Integrated into all comprehensive position validation workflows

## Error Detection

### Types of Inconsistencies Detected

1. **King Displacement**: Castling right set but King not on starting square
   ```
   CASTLING INCONSISTENCY:
     White kingside castling allowed but King not on e1
     Expected WhiteKing at e1, found: .
   ```

2. **Rook Displacement**: Castling right set but Rook not on starting square
   ```
   CASTLING INCONSISTENCY:
     Black queenside castling allowed but Rook not on a8
     Expected BlackRook at a8, found: Knight
   ```

3. **Missing Pieces**: Castling right set but required pieces are completely absent

### Success Messages
- **No castling rights**: `✓ No castling rights set (valid)`
- **Valid castling setup**: `✓ Castling rights are consistent with piece positions`
- **Rights display**: Shows current rights in standard notation (e.g., "Rights: KQkq")

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
Located in `test/test_debug_validation.cpp` with test cases covering:

1. **✅ Valid Scenarios**:
   - Starting position with all castling rights (KQkq)
   - Positions with no castling rights
   - Partial castling rights with correct piece placement

2. **✅ Invalid Scenarios**:
   - King moved but castling rights still set
   - Rook moved but castling rights still set
   - Missing pieces but castling rights still set

3. **✅ Edge Cases**:
   - Mixed valid/invalid castling rights
   - Complex positions like Kiwipete test position

### Demo Application
`castling_demo.exe` provides interactive demonstration:
- Tests 5 different castling scenarios
- Shows both passing and failing validations
- Demonstrates detailed error messages
- Validates famous chess positions

## Usage Examples

### Basic Validation
```cpp
Position pos;
pos.set_from_fen("r3k2r/8/8/8/8/8/8/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 1");

// Validate castling specifically
bool castling_valid = Debug::validate_castling_consistency(pos);

// Or use comprehensive validation
bool all_valid = Debug::validate_position_consistency(pos, expected_fen);
```

### Individual Checks
```cpp
// Check if position has valid castling setup
if (!Debug::validate_castling_consistency(pos)) {
    std::cout << "Position has invalid castling rights!" << std::endl;
    // Handle the inconsistency...
}
```

## Benefits

### 🛡️ **Data Integrity Protection**
- Prevents position corruption bugs related to castling
- Catches inconsistencies between FEN parsing and internal representation
- Validates make/unmake move implementations

### 🐛 **Bug Detection**
- Identifies when castling rights aren't properly updated after moves
- Detects issues in position setup from FEN strings
- Catches problems in incremental position updates

### 🔍 **Debugging Support**
- Detailed error messages pinpoint exact issues
- Visual feedback shows expected vs actual piece placement
- Integration with comprehensive validation system

## Real-World Applications

### Move Generation Testing
Ensure castling rights are properly maintained during:
- King moves (should clear both castling rights for that color)
- Rook moves (should clear castling rights for that rook)
- Rook captures (should clear castling rights for captured rook)

### FEN Import/Export Validation
Verify that:
- FEN strings are parsed correctly
- Castling rights match actual piece positions
- Round-trip FEN conversion maintains consistency

### Position Copy/Restore Operations
Validate that:
- Position copying preserves castling state correctly
- Undo operations restore proper castling rights
- Hash table entries have consistent castling information

## Performance Impact
- **Minimal overhead**: Only validates when explicitly called
- **Optional integration**: Can be disabled in release builds
- **Targeted validation**: Checks only relevant squares (not entire board)

## Test Results
All tests pass ✅ (74/74 total tests):
- Castling validation correctly identifies valid and invalid scenarios
- Integration with existing debug system maintains full compatibility
- Comprehensive coverage of edge cases and complex positions

This enhancement significantly strengthens the debug validation system's ability to detect castling-related position corruption, making the chess engine more robust and reliable.
