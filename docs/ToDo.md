## ðŸš§ Current Development Priorities

### **HIGH PRIORITY: Critical Performance Bottlenecks (20-50% improvement potential)**

  - [ ] Magic bitboard lookup tables for sliding pieces (bishops, rooks, queens)
  - [ ] Replace direction-based loops with bitboard operations
  - [ ] Target: 2-4x speedup for sliding piece move generation (currently 45% of movegen time)
- [ ] **Advanced Move Ordering**
  - [ ] Killer move heuristic (non-capture moves that cause cutoffs)
  - [ ] History heuristic (move success tracking across positions)
  - [ ] Hash move ordering (best move from transposition table)
  - [ ] Target: Better alpha-beta pruning efficiency
- [ ] **Precomputed Attack Tables**
  - [ ] Knight attack lookup tables (eliminate L-shape calculation)
  - [ ] King attack lookup tables (eliminate adjacent square calculation)
  - [ ] Pawn attack tables by color and square
  - [ ] Target: 2-5x speedup for non-sliding piece attacks

### **HIGH PRIORITY: Newly Identified Critical Optimizations (20-75% improvement potential)**
- [ ] **S_MOVELIST Memory Optimization** (75% memory reduction potential)
  - [ ] Replace fixed 256-move array with dynamic allocation or smaller fixed size (64 moves)
  - [ ] Current: `array<S_MOVE,256> moves` wastes 85-90% allocated memory (2KB per movelist)
  - [ ] Target: 75% memory reduction, dramatically better cache utilization
  - [ ] Impact: Positions typically have 20-40 legal moves, not 256
- [ ] **Castling Rights Lookup Table** (3-5x speedup potential)
  - [ ] Replace 8+ conditional checks per move with single lookup table operation
  - [ ] Current: `if (from == 25 || to == 25)...` repeated for all castling squares
  - [ ] Target: `castling_rights &= CASTLE_MASK[from] & CASTLE_MASK[to]`
  - [ ] Impact: 3-5x faster castling rights updates in make/unmake moves
- [ ] **Attack Detection Caching** (40-60% speedup potential)
  - [ ] Cache attack calculations to avoid redundant sq_attacked() calls
  - [ ] Current: Castling validation calls sq_attacked() multiple times for same squares
  - [ ] Target: Attack bitboard caching or batch attack detection
  - [ ] Impact: 40-60% faster castling validation and king safety checks
- [ ] **Position Copying Elimination** (60-80% threading improvement)
  - [ ] Replace full position copies in ThreadedEngine with thread-local pools
  - [ ] Current: `Position temp_pos = pos` creates expensive deep copies per thread
  - [ ] Target: Thread-local position pools or copy-on-write semantics
  - [ ] Impact: 60-80% reduction in multi-threaded search overhead

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Architecture & Performance Optimizations (10-25% improvement)**

  - [ ] Optimized promotion move generation (reduce branching)
  - [ ] Specialized en passant handling
- [ ] **Piece List Compaction** (15-25% speedup potential)
  - [ ] Eliminate -1 sentinels in piece lists to avoid wasted iterations
  - [ ] Current: `if (from == -1) continue;` wastes cycles on empty slots
  - [ ] Target: Compact piece lists without gaps for faster iteration
  - [ ] Impact: 15-25% faster piece list traversal in move generation
- [ ] **Move Scoring Optimization** (10-20% speedup potential)
  - [ ] Eliminate redundant move scoring in generation vs search phases
  - [ ] Current: Moves scored multiple times (generation + search ordering)
  - [ ] Target: Score once in generation, reuse S_MOVE.score in search
  - [ ] Impact: 10-20% search speedup by avoiding duplicate scoring
- [ ] **Memory Layout Optimization** (10-15% cache performance)
  - [ ] Reorder Position class fields by access frequency and alignment
  - [ ] Current: Scattered field layout causes cache misses
  - [ ] Target: Group frequently accessed fields for better cache locality
  - [ ] Impact: 10-15% improvement in position access patterns
- [ ] **Zobrist Hashing Performance Optimizations**
  - [ ] **HIGH IMPACT**: Optimize `Zobrist::compute()` to use piece lists instead of board scanning (2-4x faster)
  - [ ] **MEDIUM IMPACT**: Cache piece decomposition in `update_zobrist_for_move()` to reduce `color_of()`/`type_of()` calls (10-20% faster)
  - [ ] **MEDIUM IMPACT**: Ensure all move types use incremental XOR updates instead of full recomputation (5-10x faster)
  - [ ] **LOW IMPACT**: Remove redundant bounds checking in en passant file calculation (5-10% faster)
